# Hi I'm Lior Malichi :relaxed:

I'm  a second year student learning Electrical Engineering at Ben Gurion University :man_student:
Due to Coronavirus I decided to take a year off university.
My big unic project I'm working on right now is a python program which eventually will trade real money in the stock market.
Meanwhile I'm having a lot of fun creating unity games, progarmas and projects in python.

-**Gym** or just lifting random heavy stuff :joy:
